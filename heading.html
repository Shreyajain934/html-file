            Timeline
        </h2>
        <p>
            On 30 January, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala, which rose to three cases by 3 February; all were students returning from Wuhan. Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February. On 4 March 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.
In March, the transmissions grew after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India.

            Testing
        </h3>
        <p>The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[54] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country. A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission". 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained, as of early March. On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional).

            Initial testing 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines. On 20 March, the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases. The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.On 9 April, ICMR further revised the testing strategy and allowed testing of the people showing symptoms for a week in the hotspot areas of the country, regardless of travel history or local contact to a patient.

            The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity had been used per day till 15 March,claiming that the number of tests was enough. However experts thought they were not, saying that community transmission may go undetected without adequate testing.They also wanted to add more testing centres by inclusion of private laboratories.In mid-March the government authorised accredited private labs to test for the virus.</u>

            Expansion of tests
        </h5>
        <p>
            on 17 March, the Union Ministry of Health had decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19. The ministry official claimed that by allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled. The ministry said that National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited laboratories may soon be allowed. Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.
